# Data Migration Factory
This repo contains several PowerShell scripts that can support common migration scenarios, such as:
* File shares to OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online or Microsoft Teams
* SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online or Microsoft Teams
* Microsoft 365 tenant to tenant

The scripts are meant as examples to speed up the development of migration solutions within these scenarios.
